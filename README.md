# Vulkanizer
My unbelievable ultra supersonic Vulkan API engine.

## How to use
1. Instal VulkanSDK from official site: https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/
2. Install GLFW, which deletes HORRORS of Win32 programming. Installing this library means that some code in our MainWindow.cpp file will no longer be required. http://www.glfw.org/index.html
3. Install GLM, a linear algebra library. https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
