# Vulkanizer
My take on Vulkan API and HLSL. This repo will become a video game in the future.

## How to use
1. Instal VulkanSDK from official site: https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/
2. Install GLFW, which deletes HORRORS of Win32 programming.
3. Install GLM, a linear algebra library. https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
4. Include STB library. Have a look at this repo: https://github.com/nothings/stb

## List of renderable scenes:

- Color Changer - swaps colors on OS surface.
- Textured square - Square with an image you can select.
- Depth buffered textured squares - Two squares, one below the other.
